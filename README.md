# Facebook Campaign Analyses

By **Paula Pipkin** 

### Campaign Segmentation :

This is a modified dataset from kaggle for a facebook campaign.


### Data:

The inicial data was downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/madislemsalu/facebook-ad-campaign and aditional information was added.


## Methods

- Kmeans clustering (unsupervised learning) was applied.  
- Inertia and silhouette score were used to define the best number of clusters.
- Vizualizations were done to better answer our questions.
- A looker dash board was also developed.


## Results


-  2 Clusters were chosen, they differ mostly on some of the demographic aspects like education and gender.

 
## Recommendations, Limitations & Next Steps:

- This data was artificially modified, therefore I would recomend running this model in a real world dataset to analyse it's results more closely
